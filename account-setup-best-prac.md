``Root Account Email Guidance``

+ Don't use personal email
  + Unless it is for a personal account
  + Even then...
+ Consider using a distribution list email
  + Even if only one person is on the distribution
  + Or use an alias
+ Root account email can only be changed by the root user
+ If you close the account, that root mail cannot ever be used again
